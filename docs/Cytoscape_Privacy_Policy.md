# Cytoscape Privacy Policy

We respect the privacy of all Cytoscape users, and we do not collect any
information on Cytoscape users except in the situations listed below. In
no case do we attempt to tie any of this information back to a user, nor
do we give, share, sell, or transfer this information to any third party
unless required by law. We use this information only in the aggregate to
generate statistics to assist in securing continued funding for
Cytoscape.

-   On the Cytoscape download web page, we log the date, time, browser
    signature, and IP address to which we deliver Cytoscape.
    
-   When Cytoscape starts, it fetches news and version information
    from a Cytoscape server. We log the date, time, and IP address
    of the workstation running Cytoscape.
    
-   During Cytoscape execution, we log usage statistics tagged with the date, 
    time, and IP address of the workstation running Cytoscape. This
    logging can be turned off during Cytoscape installation or by
    setting the **installoptions.shareStatistics** property to false using
    the Cytoscape **Preferences Editor**.
    

This policy may change from time to time, and if it does, we will notify
you via our normal mass notification media. We will also update this 
section of the user manual.

Note that some internal Cytoscape Apps and Apps available through the
**Cytoscape App Store** connect with third party services via the Internet.
Once an App links to such a service, you are subject to the privacy
policy of that service.
