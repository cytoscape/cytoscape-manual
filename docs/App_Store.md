## What are Apps?

Cytoscape's capabilities are not fixed. They can be expanded with
**apps**. They can extend Cytoscape in a variety of ways. One app can
have the ability to import data from an online database. Another app
could provide a new method for analyzing networks. You can install apps
after you have installed Cytoscape. Most apps were made by Cytoscape
users like you.

If you're familiar with Cytoscape 2.x, you probably know that Cytoscape
apps were called **plugins**. Starting in Cytoscape 3.0, we are calling
them **apps**. Cytoscape 2.x plugins cannot be used in Cytoscape 3.x.

## Installing Apps

You can install apps through [the App Store](http://apps.cytoscape.org)
or within Cytoscape. In this section, we'll talk about installing apps
through Cytoscape. You can learn how to install apps through the App
Store [here](http://apps.cytoscape.org/help/getstarted_app_install).

To install apps within Cytoscape, go to the menu bar and choose **Apps â†’
App Manager...**. At the top of the **App Manager** window, make sure you
have the **Install Apps** tab selected.

There are four ways you can find apps:

-   If you know the name of an app you're looking for, enter it in the
    **Search** field. The **App Manager** will list the apps whose names or
    descriptions match the **Search** field in the middle panel.

-   If you're not sure what sort of app you need and want to see everything,
    click the **all apps** folder. In the middle pane, you will see a
    list of all the apps.

-   If you want to install a collection of apps for a specific use case,
    click on the **collections** folder. This will display the available
    collections in the middle pane. A collection is simply an app that
    installs other apps for a specific use case.

-   If you have a general idea of what sort of app you're looking for,
    double-click on the **apps by tag** folder, then click on one of the
    tags that interests you. The apps with that tag are listed in the
    middle pane.

When you click on an app (or collection) in the middle panel, the
**App Manager** shows its short description and icon in the right panel.
If you want more information, click the **View on App Store**
button on the bottom-right. If you want to go ahead and install,
click the **Install** button.

If you've downloaded an app to your computer, you can install it by
clicking the **Install from File** button on the bottom-left.

## Managing your Installed Apps

You can see a list of all apps you have installed by clicking the
**Currently Installed** tab at the top. When you click on an app in the
list, you'll see a description of your app at the bottom. At the bottom,
you'll see a couple buttons where you can:

-   **Uninstall** an app. This deletes the app from your computer. If
    you want to reinstall the app, you will have to find it again in the
    **Install Apps** tab or find it in the App Store site and
    reinstall it from there.

-   **Disable** an app. This temporarily disables the app. The app stays
    on your computer, but Cytoscape does not load it. You can enable the
    app by first selecting the disabled app in the list, then click
    **Enable**.

Note that uninstalling or disabling a collection will not uninstall or disable any apps installed by the collection.
