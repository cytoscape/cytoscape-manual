## What are Apps?

Cytoscape's capabilities are not fixed. They can be expanded with
**apps**. They can extend Cytoscape in a variety of ways. One app can
have the ability to import data from an online database. Another app
could provide a new method for analyzing networks. You can install apps
after you have installed Cytoscape. Most apps were made by Cytoscape
users like you.

If you're familiar with Cytoscape 2.x, you probably know that Cytoscape
apps were called **plugins**. Starting in Cytoscape 3.0, we are calling
them **apps**. Cytoscape 2.x plugins cannot be used in Cytoscape 3.x.

## Installing Apps

You can install apps through [the App Store](http://apps.cytoscape.org)
or within Cytoscape. In this section, we'll talk about installing apps
through Cytoscape. You can learn how to install apps through the App
Store [here](http://apps.cytoscape.org/help/getstarted_app_install).

There are three ways you can find apps:

-   If you know the name of an app you're looking for, enter it in the
    **Search** field, and click the search button. The **App Store** will list the apps whose names or
    descriptions match the **Search** field in the web page.

-   If you're not sure what sort of app you need and want to see everything,
    click the **Browse all apps** button.

-   If you have a general idea of what sort of app you're looking for,
    go to [the App Store](http://apps.cytoscape.org). On the left side, click on one of the
    categories that interests you. The apps with that tag are listed in the
    web page.
