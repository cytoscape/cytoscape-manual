# Command Panel

The **Command Panel** provides a simple command-line interface to
Cytoscape using the **Commands API**. It allows the user to type commands into
Cytoscape and see the results in a **Reply Log**.

Any app that registers commands will
be available through the **Command Panel**. Commands are part of the more general
[Cytoscape Automation](Programmatic_Access_to_Cytoscape_Features_Scripting.html#cytoscape_automation) feature, 
which includes multiple ways of scripting Cytoscape execution.

The **Command Panel** can be opened from **View → Show/Hide Command Panel**.

The **Command Panel** can also be used to read and execute script files. 
Each line in the script file is a command that is sent to a app.
Script files may be entered on the Cytoscape command line using the _-S_
flag to Cytoscape, through the **Tools → Run Script File...** menu item,
or through **Tools → Execute Command File** menu item.

Cytoscape commands consist of three parts: a command class, or
namespace; a command within that namespace; and a series of arguments or
options provided as a series of **name=value** pairs. For example, to
import an XGMML format file from the **Command Line Dialog** or a
command script, you would use:

    network import file filePath="path-to-file"

where **network** is the namespace, **import file** is the command, and
there is only one argument: *filePath="path-to-file"*. If there were
more arguments they would appear on the same line separated by spaces.

The **Command Panel** also uses the Command API to provide help. **help** by
itself will list all of the command classes (or namespaces) and **help**
followed by a namespace will list all of the commands supported by that
namespace. Details of a specific command are available by typing **help**
followed by the namespace and command (e.g. **help layout
force-directed**). The **Command Panel** registers the **command** namespace and
supports a single command: run, which takes a file argument. Here is the
help for the command run command from the command namespace:

    help command run
           command run file=<File> 

Similarly, the help for the **network import file** example from above is:

    help network import file
     network import file arguments:
     dataTypeList=<String>: List of column data types ordered by column index 
	   (e.g. "string,int,long,double,boolean,intlist" or just "s,i,l,d,b,il")
     defaultInteraction=<String>: Default interaction type
     delimiters=<ListMultipleSelection [,,;, ,\t]>: Text Delimiters
     delimitersForDataList=<ListSingleSelection (\||\|/|,)>: 
	   Text Delimiters for data list type
     file=<File>: Data Table file
     firstRowAsColumnNames=true|false: First row used for column names
     indexColumnSourceInteraction=<int>: Column for source interaction
     indexColumnTargetInteraction=<int>: Column for target interaction
     indexColumnTypeInteraction=<int>: Column for interaction type
     NetworkViewRendererList=<ListSingleSelection ()>: Network View Renderer
     RootNetworkList=<ListSingleSelection (-- Create new network collection 
	   --|Network)>: Network Collection
     startLoadRow=<int>: Start Load Row
     TargetColumnList=<ListSingleSelection ()>: Node Identifier Mapping Column
