## Basic Network Navigation

Cytoscape uses a [Zoomable User
Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooming_User_Interface) for
navigating and viewing networks. ZUIs use two mechanisms for navigation:
zooming and panning. Zooming increases or decreases the magnification of
a view based on how much or how little a user wants to see. Panning
allows users to move the focus of a screen to different parts of a view.

<a id="zoom"> </a>
### Zoom

Cytoscape provides four mechanisms for zooming: toolbar buttons, menu options, keyboard shortcuts and the scroll wheel.

Use the zooming buttons located on the toolbar to zoom in
and out of the interaction network shown in the current network display.
Zoom icons are detailed below:

![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/zoomicons.png)

From Left to Right:

**Zoom In**

  - Menu option: **View → Zoom In**
  - Keyboard shortcut: ``Ctrl-Plus`` (``Command-Plus`` on Mac OS X)


**Zoom Out**

  - Menu option: **View → Zoom Out**
  - Keyboard shortcut: ``Ctrl-Minus`` (``Command-Minus`` on Mac OS X)


**Fit Content**: Zoom level is adjusted to fit the network to the window 

  - Menu option: **View → Fit Content**
  - Keyboard shortcut: ``Ctrl-0`` (``Command-0`` on Mac OS X)


**Fit Selected**: Zoom level is adjusted to zoom on any selected nodes

  - Menu option: **View → Fit Selected**
  - Keyboard shortcut: ``Ctrl-9`` (``Command-9`` on Mac OS X)


Using the scroll wheel, you can zoom in by scrolling up and zoom out by
scrolling downwards. These directions are reversed on Macs with natural
scrolling enabled (the default for Mac OS X Lion and newer versions).

<a id="pan"> </a>
### Pan

There are two ways to pan the network:

-   Left-Click and Drag - You can pan the network view by holding down the left mouse button and moving the mouse.

-   Dragging Box on **[Network
    Overview](Quick_Tour_of_Cytoscape.html#the-network-overview-window)** -
    You can also pan the view by left-clicking and dragging the blue box in the overview panel in the lower part of the view.

<a id="other_mouse_behaviors"> </a>
## Other Mouse Behaviors

<a id="select"> </a>
### Select

- Click the left mouse button on a node, edge or annotation to select that element.
- Hold down the ``Shift`` or ``Ctrl`` key (``Command`` on Mac) and left-click a node, edge or annotation to add it to the selection. Doing the same on a selected element unselects it.
- Hold down the left mouse button on the canvas background and drag the mouse while holding down the ``Shift`` or ``Ctrl`` key (``Command`` on Mac) to select groups of nodes/edges/annotations using a classic rectangular selection area.
- Hold down the left mouse button on the canvas background and drag the mouse while holding down ``Option`` + ``Shift`` (``Command`` + ``Shift`` on Mac) to select groups of nodes/edges/annotations using a lasso selection tool.
- Remember that the selection action (mouse click or drag-selection) only works if the **Selection Mode** for that element type (i.e. nodes, edges, annotations) is enabled. In order to enable or disable the selection of an element type, just toggle its corresponding button at the bottom of the network view (see image below) or use the options under the menu **Select → Mouse Drag Selects**.

![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/SelectionModeButtons.png)

  - So if you don't want any **nodes** to be selected, toggle the button ![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/selection-mode-nodes.png) off.
  - And if you don't want any **edges** to be selected, toggle the button ![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/selection-mode-edges.png) off.
  - Likewise, if you don't want any **annotations** to be selected, toggle the button ![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/selection-mode-annotations.png) off.

<a id="context"> </a>
### Context

Click the right mouse button (or Ctrl+left mouse button on Macs) on a
node/edge to launch a context-sensitive menu with additional information
about the node/edge.

<a id="node_context_menu"> </a>
### Node Context Menu

This menu can change based on the current context. For nodes, it
typically shows:

-   Add

-   Diffuse

-   Edit

-   Select

-   Group

-   Nested Networks

-   Apps

-   External Links

-   Preferences

Edges usually have the following menu:

-   Diffuse

-   Edit

-   Select

-   Apps

-   External Links

-   Preferences

Apps can contribute their own items into node and edge context menus.
These additions usually appear in the **Apps** section of the context
menu.

<a id="nested_network_node_context_menu"> </a>
#### Nested Network Node Context Menu

-   **Add Nested Network**: Lets the user select any network in
    Cytoscape as the current node's nested network. If the current node
    already has a nested network it will be replaced.

-   **Remove Nested Network**: Removes the currently associated nested
    network from a node. The associated network is not deleted. Only the
    association between the node and the network is removed.

-   **Go to Nested Network**: The current node's nested network will be
    the current network view and have the focus. Should a network view
    for the nested network not exist, it will be created.

More information about nested networks can be found in the **[Nested
Networks](Nested_Networks.html#nested-networks)**
section.

<a id="manual_layout"> </a>
## Manual Layout

The simplest method to manually organize a network is to click on a node
and drag it. All of the selected nodes are moved together.

In addition to the ability to click on a node and drag it to a new
position, Cytoscape now has the ability to move nodes using the arrow
keys on the keyboard. By selecting one or more nodes using the mouse and
clicking one of the arrow keys (←, ↑, →, ↓) the selected nodes will move
one pixel in the chosen direction. If an arrow key is pressed while
holding the Shift key down, the selected nodes will move 15 pixels in the
chosen direction.

<a id="node_layout_tools"> </a>
## Node Layout Tools
The Tool Panel is available via the menu command **View → Show Tool Panel**, or via **Layout → Node Layout Tools**.

It contains several **Node Layout Tools** that can help to automate or fine tune a layout.  

<a id="scale"> </a>
### Scale
Adjust the Scale slider to change the length of edges.  The position of the nodes will be scaled, not the node sizes. 
Node size can be adjusted using
**[Styles](Styles.html)**.
The images below show selected (yellow) nodes scaled to 50% of the default value.

**Before**

![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/NodeTools1.png)

**After**

![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/NodeToolsScaled.png)
<a id="rotate"> </a>
### Rotate

The Rotate function will change the orientation of the entire
network or a selected portion of the network. The images below show a
network with selected nodes rotated 90 degrees.

**Before**

**After**

<a id="align_distribute_and_stack"> </a>
### Align, Distribute and Stack

The **Tool Panel** contains buttons to set relative postions of nodes.

**Align** provides
different options for either vertically or horizontally aligning
selected nodes against a line. The differences are in what part of the
node gets aligned, e.g. the center of the node, the top of the node, the
left side of the node. **Distribute** evenly distributes selected nodes
between the two most distant nodes along either the vertical or
horizontal axis. The differences are again a function what part of the
node is used as a reference point for the distribution. **Stack**
vertically or horizontally stacks selected nodes with the full
complement of alignment options. The table below provides a description
of what each button does.

## Edge Bend and Automatic Edge Bundling

From Cytoscape 3.0, **Edge Bend** is a regular edge property and can be
used as a part of a **Style**. Just like any other edge property, you
can select a Default Value, a Mapping and use Bypass for select nodes.
In the Style tab, select the **Bend** property from the **Properties**
drop-down and click on either the Default Value, Mapping or Bypass cell
to bring up the **Edge Bend Editor**. In the editor, you can add as many
handles as you want to the edge using **Alt-Click** on Windows, **Option-Click**
on Mac, or **Ctrl-Alt-Click** on Linux.

![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/edbeBend1.png)

![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/bundle1.png)

To clear all edge bends, select **Layout → Clear All Edge Bends**.

In addition to adding handles manually, you can use the **Bundle Edges**
function to bundle all or selected edges automatically.

![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/bundle2.png)

1.  Select **Layout → Bundle Edges → All Nodes and Edges**.

2.  Set parameters.

    -   Details of the algorithm is described in [this
        paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01450.x).

3.  Press **OK** to run. Edge bundling may take a long time if the number of
    edges is large.

    -   If it takes too long, try decreasing **Maximum Iterations.**

    -   For large, dense networks, try setting **Maximum iterations** in
        the range of 500 - 1000.

Note: The handle locations will be optimized for current location of
nodes. If you move node positions, you need to run the function again to
get proper result.


<a id="automatic_layout_algorithms"> </a>
## Automatic Layout Algorithms

The **Layout** menu has an array of features for organizing the network
visually according to one of several algorithms, aligning and rotating
groups of nodes, and adjusting the size of the network. Cytoscape
layouts have three different sources, which are reflected in the
**Layout** menu.

Cytoscape layouts have the option to operate on only the selected nodes,
and all provide a **Settings...** panel to change the parameters of the
algorithm. Most of the Cytoscape layouts also partition the graph before
performing the layout. In addition, many of these layouts include the
option to take either node or edge columns into account. A few of the
layout algorithms are:

<a id="grid_layout"> </a>
### Grid Layout

![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/grid_layout.png)

The grid layout is a simple layout the arranges all of the nodes in a
square grid. This is the default layout and is always available as part
of the Cytoscape core. It is available by selecting **Layout → Grid
Layout**. A sample screen shot is shown above.

<a id="edge-weighted_spring-embedded_layout"> </a>
### Edge-weighted Spring-Embedded Layout

![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/spring.png)

The spring-embedded layout is based on a force-directed paradigm as
implemented by Kamada and Kawai (1988). Network nodes are treated like
physical objects that repel each other, such as electrons. The
connections between nodes are treated like metal springs attached to the
pair of nodes. These springs repel or attract their end points according
to a force function. The layout algorithm sets the positions of the
nodes in a way that minimizes the sum of forces in the network. This
algorithm can be applied to the entire network or a portion of it by
selecting the appropriate options from **Layout → Edge-weighted Spring
Embedded**.

<a id="attribute_circle_layout"> </a>
### Attribute Circle Layout

![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/attribute_circle_layout.png)

The **Attribute Circle** layout is a quick, useful layout, particularly
for small networks, that will locate all of the nodes in the network
around a circle. The node order is determined by a user-selected node
column. The result is that all nodes with the same value for that column
are located together around the circle. Using **Layout → Attribute
Circle Layout →** ***column*** to put all nodes around a circle using
***column*** to position them. The sample screen shot above shows the a
subset of the galFiltered network organized by node degree.

<a id="group_attributes_layout"> </a>
### Group Attributes Layout

![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/group_by_attributes_layout.png)

The **Group Attributes** layout is similar to the **Attribute Circle**
layout described above except that instead of a single circle with all
of the nodes, each set of nodes that share the same value for the column
are laid out in a separate circle. The same network shown above (network
generated by PSICQUIC Client) is shown above, using **Layout → Group
Attributes Layout → taxonomy**.

<a id="prefuse_force_directed_layout"> </a>
### Prefuse Force Directed Layout

![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/force_layout.png)

The force-directed layout is a layout based on the force-directed
paradigm. This layout is based on the algorithm implemented as part of
the prefuse toolkit <!--[prefuse toolkit (http://www.prefuse.org/)](http://www.prefuse.org/)-->provided by Jeff Heer.
The algorithm is very fast and with the right parameters can provide a
very visually pleasing layout. The **Force Directed Layout** will also
accept a numeric edge column to use as a weight for the length of the
spring, although this will often require more use of the **Settings...**
dialog to achieve the best layout. This algorithm is available by
selecting **Layout → Prefuse Force-Directed Layout → (unweighted)** or
the edge column you want to use as a weight. A sample screen shot
showing a portion of the galFiltered network provided in sample data is
provided above.

<a id="compound_spring_embedder_layout"> </a>
### Compound Spring Embedder Layout

![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/cose_layout.png)

The [Compound Spring Embedder (CoSE)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025508004799)
layout is based on the traditional force-directed
layout algorithm with extensions to handle multi-level nesting (compound nodes),
edges between nodes of arbitrary nesting levels and varying node sizes.
It is the suggested Cytoscape layout for compound graphs,
although it also works very well with noncompound graphs.
It is available by selecting **Layout → Compound Spring Embedder (CoSE)**.

<a id="yfiles_circular_layout"> </a>
### Circular Layout

![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/yCircular.png)

This algorithm produces layouts that emphasize group and tree structures
within a network. It partitions the network by analyzing its
connectivity structure, and arranges the partitions as separate circles.
The circles themselves are arranged in a radial tree layout fashion.
This algorithm is available by selecting **Layout → Circular Layout**.

### Hierarchical Layout

![](_static/images/Navigation_Layout/yHir.png)

The hierarchical layout algorithm is good for representing main
direction or flow within a network. Nodes are placed in hierarchically
arranged layers and the ordering of the nodes within each layer is
chosen in such a way that minimizes the number of edge crossings. This
algorithm is available by selecting **Layout → Hierarchical Layout**.

### Copycat Layout

The Copycat layout uses node positions in one network to lay out nodes in another network. Selecting **Layout → Copycat Layout** 
displays a dialog box that allows you to select the source network (which is already laid out) and the target network (which needs layout). By default, Copycat matches nodes in the source and target networks by node name, but you can choose any node attribute for this match.

As options, you can use **Select unmapped nodes** to cause Copycat to select target nodes that were not matched by nodes in the source network. This allows you to move them and possibly lay them out using other layout algorithms. You can use the **Layout unmapped nodes in a grid** option to preemptively move the unmatched target nodes away from the laid out target network.

## yFiles Layouts

Cytoscape offers a set of layout algorithms based on the [yFiles library](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles). As of
Cytoscape 3.6, the yFiles algorithms are available directly through the [Cytoscape App Store](http://apps.cytoscape.org/). To install them,
go to **Layout → Install yFiles**, which will direct you to the 
App Store. Click the **Install** 
button to proceed. You will be directed to a license agreement, and once yFiles is 
installed, the yFiles layouts will be available in the **Layout** menu. 

The layout algorithms included in yFiles are:

-   Circular Layout

-   Hierarchic Layout

-   Hierarchic Layout Selected Nodes

-   Organic Layout

-   Orthogonal Layout

-   Radial Layout

-   Tree Layout

-   Orthogonal Edge Router

-   Organic Edge Router

Below are a few examples of yFiles layouts in Cytoscape, with more available from [yFiles](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-layout-algorithms-for-cytoscape).

## Layout Parameters

Many layouts have adjustable parameters that are exposed through the
**Layouts → Settings...** menu option. The **Layout Settings** dialog,
which allows you to choose which layout algorithm settings to adjust, is
shown below. The settings presented vary by algorithm and only those
algorithms that allow access to their parameters will appear in the
drop-down menu at the top of the dialog. Once you've modified a
parameter, clicking the **Execute Layout** button will apply the layout.
